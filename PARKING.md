# Parking for CoderDojo Ponce Springs

We have two dojo locations:

# 1. Midtown Atlanta office in The Stove Works building

## Finding Us
* We're at The Stove Works building: 112 Krog Street Suite 17, Atlanta, GA. It's at the intersection of Irwin Street and Krog Street.
* Directly across from Superica in Krog Street Market.
* You have to come through the inside of the building to suite 17 at the end.

## Visitor Parking
* **Visitor parking in the Alexan parking parking deck can be limited!** The deck is to the left Stove Works, near Bell Street Burrito. Visitor spaces are on the bottom floor.

# 2. Alpharetta VersionOne headquarters

Occassionally we have events in Alpharetta. Parking there is super easy.

The address is 6220 Shiloh Road Suite 400. Atlanta, GA 30005. It is off McFarland Road, which is exit 12 on 400. If driving north on 400, then turn right. If coming south, turn left. The turn to Shiloh road is just past the parking area for the Big Creek Greenway trail -- a nice place to walk after a dojo, no doubt.

Dojo events are held on the bottom floor, so you can park around the back of the building and enter through the doors on the bottom. We're in the same building as the Taco Mac office. Unfortunately, there is no Taco Mac restaurant there though.
