# CoderDojo Ponce Springs Event: Sat Aug 16, 1:00 to 4:15 PM

Welcome to CoderDojo Ponce Springs -- **_the free and fun place where Atlanta's kids code apps, games, sites, and more -- supported by mentors, parents, and a [global community](http://www.CoderDojo.com)!_**

We follow [CoderDojo principles](Promise.md). Our events have two halves: the first to support beginners, the second for returning students working on our ongoing mentor-led series tracks. 

## Our current series tracks

* [Learn to Program with Minecraft Plugins](Workshops/MinecraftPlugins/README.md)
* [HTML5 Game Development with JavaScript and Quintus](Workshops/HTML5GamesQuintus/README.md)

## See what it's all about

# How do I sign up?!?

To help ensure privacy for our members, **parents** please sign up for your kids / students at [CoderDojo Ponce Springs August 16th RSVP page](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings/events/172340752/)! There is no cost to sign up, you just have to join Meetup.com so that we can get a head count. **If downtown Atlanta is too far for you, see the bottom of this page for our offspring dojos in Georgia!

# Follow us on Twitter for updates and links to coding resources

We're [@CoderDojoPonce](https://twitter.com/CoderDojoPonce). 

# What should I and my kids / students do before we attend?

There is some homework. Don't worry, it's fun!

## Parents

**Remember to bring a laptop for your student.** We have some machines that you can borrow during the event, but they are all Linux based, and not everyone is familiar with Linux.

**We recommend you do one of the beginner videos linked below together with your students**. However, let the student control the keyboard as much as possible. For inspiration, see [Sugata Mitra's Child-Driven Education TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education).

## Volunteers, Mentors

First time voluneeters must [complete this application and background check authorization](http://coderdojoponcesprings.azurewebsites.net/app/index.html#/). Thank you.

## Students

Students, remember that the dojo is a partly a ["flipped classroom"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_teaching), but mostly a **playground**. 

This means you should start **coding at home before you attend events**, starting with the resources linked below. Come to the event having tried something already. We'll help you go further and have fun with what you're learning!

### What interests you most?

We want you to feel free to pursue whatever programming languages, tools, and ideas are most interesting to **you**. You can always ask a mentor about things that you want to get into or to demo things you've tried at home.

### What's your current experience with coding?

Think about where you fit against these descriptions:

* **Beginner level**: You are totally new or have little exposure to programming and / or web development

* **Intermediate level**: You have some experience with coding, but want to dig into concepts like game development, 
object-oriented programming, events, and web programming

* **Advanced level**: You have already been programming for a while and have your own project that you'd like to 
discuss with other students or mentors that can help you go further.

## Directions and Parking Tips
